# Bcrypt Password Hashing in Node.js

Bcrypt is a password hashing function designed by Niels Provos and David MaziÃ¨res, based on the Blowfish cipher. It provides a secure way to hash passwords in Node.js applications. This guide will show you how to use the bcrypt module to hash passwords and store them securely.

## Installation

First, install the bcrypt module via npm:

```bash
npm install --save bcrypt
```

## Cryptography Terms

Before we dive into the implementation, let's understand some important terms:

- **Salt:** A random data used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data.
  
- **Salt Rounds:** The cost factor indicating the time needed to calculate a single bcrypt hash. Higher salt rounds increase the time and difficulty of brute-forcing.

## Implementation

```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const saltRounds = 10;
const yourPassword = "someRandomPasswordHere";
```

There are two ways to hash a password using bcrypt:

### 1. Generate a Salt and Hash on Separate Function Calls

```javascript
bcrypt.genSalt(saltRounds, (err, salt) => {
    bcrypt.hash(yourPassword, salt, (err, hash) => {
        // Store the password hash in the database.
    });
});
```

### 2. Auto-generate a Salt and Hash on the Same Function Call

```javascript
bcrypt.hash(yourPassword, saltRounds, (err, hash) => {
    // Store the password hash in the database.
});
```

To compare a user-entered password with the stored password hash:

```javascript
// Load hash from the database.
bcrypt.compare(myPlaintextPassword, hash, function(err, res) {
    if (res == true) {
        // Password matched.
    } else {
        // Wrong password.
    }
});
```

Both methods mentioned above can also be achieved with promises, as these methods (`hash` and `compare`) return a Promise when a callback is not defined.

Bcrypt also provides synchronous methods like `genSaltSync`, `hashSync`, and `compareSync`, but asynchronous methods are preferred to prevent blocking the event loop, as bcrypt hashing is CPU intensive.
